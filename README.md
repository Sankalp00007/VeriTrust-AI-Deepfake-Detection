AI-Powered Deepfake & Misinformation Detection Platform
📌 Overview

With the rapid advancement of generative AI, deepfake videos, manipulated images, and misleading text content are increasingly being used for scams, misinformation, blackmail, and fraud. Verifying the authenticity of such digital content has become difficult for common users as well as legal professionals.

VeriTrust-AI is an AI-driven, explainable content verification platform that helps users identify potential deepfakes and misinformation across text, images, and videos. The platform provides confidence-based risk scores with transparent explanations, empowering users to make informed decisions before trusting or sharing content.

🎯 Problem Statement

There is no simple, accessible, and transparent system that allows people to verify digital content authenticity in real time. Existing solutions are either slow, overly technical, or not designed for non-experts, allowing misinformation and deepfake-based crimes to spread unchecked.

💡 Solution

TruthLens provides a web-based AI-assisted verification system with two dedicated modes:

Simple User Mode – for general users to verify content easily

Lawyer Mode – for cyber-crime lawyers and legal professionals to perform preliminary digital evidence screening

The platform uses Google Gemini API for multimodal reasoning and explainability, following Responsible AI principles.

⚠️ TruthLens does not replace human judgment or legal decision-making.
It acts as an AI-assisted support tool.
