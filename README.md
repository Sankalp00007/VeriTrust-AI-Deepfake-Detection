🛡️ AI-Driven Deepfake & Misinformation Detection Platform
📌 Overview

The rapid advancement of generative AI has made it easy to create deepfake videos, manipulated images, and misleading text content, leading to the widespread spread of misinformation. This project aims to address this challenge by providing a simple, accessible, and explainable AI-assisted content verification platform.

Our solution allows users to upload text, images, or videos and receive a confidence-based risk assessment along with clear explanations, helping them make informed decisions before trusting or sharing digital content.

🎯 Problem Statement

There is currently no user-friendly and transparent tool that enables common users to verify the authenticity of digital content in real time. Existing solutions are either slow, complex, or inaccessible to non-experts, allowing misinformation to spread unchecked.

💡 Solution

We propose a web-based AI-assisted deepfake and misinformation detection platform that:

Analyzes content using multimodal AI

Provides fake probability scores

Explains why content may be misleading

Keeps humans in the decision loop

Does not censor content, only flags risk

The platform follows Responsible AI principles and focuses on trust, transparency, and usability.
